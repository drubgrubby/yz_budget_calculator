# Yardzen Budget Calculator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About This Project

This project was created from a coding challenge. The assignment was to create a budget calculator. The user can make selections from options pulled from a Firebase db. The calculator adds up the cost from the high and low cost options from each section, and then tells the user if they are over or under budget.
